This mod adds a new block called the Power Adapter. This block can accept Tesla, RF, Forge Energy, and MJ power, and converts it into a universal power that can be converted back into those types. 

- Tesla = 25 power
- Redstone Flux = 25 power
- Forge Energy = 25 power
- Minecraft Joules = 100 power

This block has no crafting recipe. The block is intended for modpacks to set up and make it work with their own progression and balance systems.
